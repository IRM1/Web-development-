            Traffic Control Measures:
          </h3>
          <p>
            The concept of traffic control dates back to ancient civilizations,
            where traffic was managed through the use of hand signals, flags,
            and even simple road signs. In the 18th century, London employed
            traffic officers known as "link-boys" who used lanterns to direct
            horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians.

            Gas-Powered Traffic Light (1868):
          </h3>
          <p>
            The first documented traffic control device resembling a modern
            traffic light was developed by J.P. Knight, a British railway
            engineer, in 1868. Knight's design used gas lamps with red and green
            lights, operated manually by a police officer.

            of Automated Signals (1920s-1930s):
          </h3>
          <p>
            The next major milestone was the development of automated traffic
            signal systems, which used timers to control the changing of lights
            rather than manual operation. Innovations in traffic signal
            technology led to more efficient traffic flow and reduced
            congestion.
